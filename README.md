Polka dot plot code for analysis of Chandra-observed x-ray emission from massive stars' stellar winds.
Please note the markdown cell at the top of the code, providing instructions for proper use.
With all .txt and .dat files installed to the same folder as the code, it should 'run all' properly with the test data.

FILES INCLUDED <br>
Zeta Pup Plots (master).ipynb - code for producing polka dot plots as well as basic spectra <br>
TESTdat.dat - sample data to ensure the code is running properly <br>
zpup_lines.txt - text file containing names and central wavelengths of emission lines <br>
zpup_mlines.txt - text file containing emission and continuum boundaries for MEG data <br>
zpup_hlines.txt - text file containing emission and continuum boundaries for HEG data <br>
