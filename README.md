# polkadot
Polka dot plot code for analysis of Chandra-observed x-ray emission from massive stars' stellar winds.
Please note the markdown cell at the top of the code, providing instructions for proper use.
With .txt and .dat files installed to the same folder as the code, it should 'run all' properly with the test data.

FILES INCLUDED <br>
PolkaDot_Plot.ipynb - code for producing polka dot plots as well as basic spectra <br>
TESTdat.dat - sample data to ensure the code is running properly <br>
zpup_lines.txt - text file containing information on emission lines. Follows structure: <br>
&emsp;column 1 - line names <br>
&emsp;column 2 - line central wavelength (Angstroms) <br>
&emsp;column 3 - line temperatures (Kelvin) <br>
&emsp;columns 4 & 5 - MEG emission boundaries <br>
&emsp;columns 6 & 7 - MEG continuum boundaries <br>
&emsp;columns 8 & 9 - HEG emission boundaries <br>
&emsp;columns 10 & 11 - HEG continuum boundaries <br>
